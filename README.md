# odin-recipes
The current "recipes" project is a website that provides a collection of delicious and easy-to-follow recipes. The main index page includes links to a few recipes, each of which includes a list of ingredients and step-by-step instructions for preparing the dish.

Once the project is completed, you will have demonstrated skills in web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating the website's layout and functionality. You will also have demonstrated knowledge of web development tools such as Git for version control and GitHub for hosting the website.
